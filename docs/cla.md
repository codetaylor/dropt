Please read this CLA carefully before accepting its terms. By accepting the CLA, You are agreeing to be bound by its terms. If You want to accept this CLA, complete the form completely, print a copy for Your records, and when ready, press the “Accept” button at the end of this form.

As used in this CLA: (i) “You" (or "Your") shall mean the entity that is making this Agreement with the Dropt project; (ii)"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is submitted by You to the Dropt project for inclusion in, or documentation of, the project; and (iii) “Submit” (or “Submitted”) means any form of communication sent to the Dropt project (e.g. the content You post on electronic mailing lists, forums, content management systems, source code control systems, code review systems, issue tracking systems, etc. that are used by the Dropt project).

This agreement applies to all Contributions You Submit.

This CLA, and the license(s) associated with the particular Dropt project You are contributing to, provides a license to Your Contributions to the Dropt project and downstream consumers, but You still own Your Contributions, and except for the licenses provided for in this CLA, You reserve all right, title and interest in Your Contributions.

The Dropt project requires that each Contribution You Submit now or in the future to comply with the following four commitments.

  1. You will only Submit Contributions where You have authored 100% of the content.
  2. You will only Submit Contributions to which You have the necessary rights. This means that if You are employed You have received the necessary permissions from Your employer to make the Contributions.
  3. Whatever content You Contribute will be provided under the license(s) associated with the particular Dropt project You are contributing to. You can see the license(s), or find links to the license(s) in the LICENSE.txt included in the project.
  4. You understand and agree that the Dropt project and Your contributions are public, and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information You submit with it, including Your sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with the license(s) involved.

You will promptly notify the Dropt project if You become aware of any facts or circumstances that would make these commitments inaccurate in any way. To do so, please create a new issue on the github repository.
